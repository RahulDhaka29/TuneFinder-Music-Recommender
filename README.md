# üéµ TuneFinder - Music Recommendation System

**TuneFinder** is a content-based music recommendation system built with **Python, Flask, Scikit-learn**, and the **Spotify API**.  
Enter a song you like, and get recommendations for 5 other songs with similar audio features! üé∂

---

## ‚ú® Features

- üéß **Content-Based Recommendations:**  
  Recommends songs based on their intrinsic audio features (like danceability, energy, tempo, valence, etc.) using cosine similarity.

- üñºÔ∏è **Spotify Integration:**  
  Fetches real-time album cover art and metadata using the Spotify Web API.

- üíª **Interactive UI:**  
  A clean, modern, and responsive web interface built using **Flask** and **Tailwind CSS**.

- üîó **"Listen on Spotify" Links:**  
  Provides direct links to play the recommended tracks on the Spotify platform.

- üèÜ **Top 50 Popular Songs:**  
  The homepage showcases a curated list of the **50 most popular tracks** from the processed dataset.

## Dataset üìä

This project uses the "120 years of Olympic history, athletes and results" dataset.

**Source:** [Kaggle Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results)

**Required Files:** To run the analysis notebook (`olympics_analysis.ipynb`), you must first download the following files from the Kaggle link above and place them in the main project directory:
* `athlete_events.csv`
* `noc_regions.csv`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tunefinder-music-recommender.git
cd tunefinder-music-recommender
```

> Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

#### On Windows:
```bash
.env\Scriptsctivate
```

#### On macOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Get Spotify API Credentials

1. Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/).
2. Log in and **create a new application**.
3. Note down your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
4. In your app settings, add the following as a Redirect URI:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```
   (or your local development URL)

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Set Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env` in the project‚Äôs root directory (same level as `app.py`). Add your credentials:

```env
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental commits of your API keys.

---

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Ensure model files `songs_dict.pkl`, `scaled_features.npy`, and `popular.pkl` are present in the root directory.  
   If not, run the **`music-recommendation-system.ipynb`** notebook to generate them.

2. Activate your virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Run the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open your browser and visit:  
   üëâ [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)

## üß† Model Building Process (Summary)

The **`music-recommendation-system.ipynb`** notebook details the model creation:

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning:**  
   Loaded Spotify track and artist data; handled missing song names.

2. **Feature Engineering:**  
   Merged datasets on artist ID, filtered songs (released ‚â• 2000, popularity > 60), selected relevant audio features, and handled duplicate song names.

3. **Feature Scaling:**  
   Applied `MinMaxScaler` from Scikit-learn to normalize audio features between 0 and 1.

4. **Model Export:**  
   Saved final song data (`songs_dict.pkl`), scaled features array (`scaled_features.npy`), and popularity list (`popular.pkl`).  
   *(Similarity is now calculated on-the-fly in the app; `similarity.pkl` is deprecated.)*
